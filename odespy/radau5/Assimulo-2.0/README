Assimulo is a Python based simulation package that allows for simulation of both 
ordinary differential equations of the form f(t,y), (explicit problems) and 
differential algebraic equations of the form f(t,y,yd), (implicit problems). 
Assimulo currently supports Explicit Euler, adaptive Runge-Kutta of order 4 
and Runge-Kutta of order 4. It also wraps the popular SUNDIALS 
(https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html) solvers CVode 
(for explicit problems) and IDA (for implicit problems). A Python version of 
Ernst Hairer's code (http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html) Radau5 is also available. 
CVode and IDA supports discontinuous systems of the form f(t,y,sw) and f(t,y,yd,sw) with
event(root)-functions defined as g(t,y,sw) and g(t,y,yd,sw) where
sw should be fixed during the integration.

The package comes with a Problem specifications class and subclasses corresponding 
to the different problem, Implicit_Problem and Explicit_Problem. To define and 
solve a problem, first import the solver of choice and the appropriate 
(Implicit/Explicit)_Problem class. Then define your function, f and initial conditions
which pass to the problem class constructor. Then create your solver, set the attributes 
(method, absolute/relative tolerance etc.) and use the simulate method to simulate.
